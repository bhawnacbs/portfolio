<h1> 1. Clarify Your Vision</h1>
<h6>Start by defining what your "best life" looks like. What are your goals, dreams, and values? Be specific about what you want in all areas of your life: career, relationships, health, personal growth, and finances. Write it down, visualize it, and feel the emotions connected to those dreams. A clear vision provides direction and focus.</h2>
